# Python Studies

This repo is supposed to contain the code related to my studies in python. So far it doesn't have much, since all my python code is going into my [data-science repo](https://github.com/lucasclopesr/data-science). However I figured I should leave them separated because I have plans to transform this into a more general python repo (containing stuff like web scraping, CTF code challenges and Online Judge problems).
